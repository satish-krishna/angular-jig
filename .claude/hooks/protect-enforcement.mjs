// PreToolUse enforcement guard: the gate with no dial.
//
// The capstone measured the agent under test editing `stylelint.config.mjs` to
// widen a rule that was blocking it, byte-identically, in two of three gate-on
// trials. A third trial invented a CSS-variable indirection to dodge the same
// rule. The tally then reported `raw-css-literal: 0` for those trials, and part
// of that zero was the agent widening the rule rather than obeying it.
//
// The driver already detects this after the fact and voids the run. Detection is
// a smoke alarm; this is not leaving the gas on. A PreToolUse hook DENIES the
// edit before it happens, so the enforcement configuration is not writable by
// the thing being enforced, and the constitution has no dial to turn.
//
// Two design points worth stating, because both are easy to get wrong:
//
// 1. It matches Bash as well as the file-editing tools. A guard that only
//    watches Write/Edit/MultiEdit is trivially walked around with `sed -i`, a
//    shell redirect, `cp`, or `git checkout` of another revision's config. A
//    guard with a known bypass is decoration.
//
// 2. It is registered in BOTH run conditions, unlike every other hook here.
//    This is not a house-convention gate; it is an experimental control, the
//    same kind of thing as the driver's clean-working-tree check. gate-off's
//    premise is that no house conventions are enforced, not that the harness is
//    editable. Registering it in only one arm would leave the baseline free to
//    tamper, which would be a worse asymmetry than the one it fixes.
//
// WHAT THIS GUARD CANNOT DO, stated rather than discovered later. The Bash arm
// scans the command text for a literal protected path, and a shell can always
// name a file without spelling it: `F=stylelint; sed -i s/a/b/ $F.config.mjs`,
// a glob (`sed -i s/a/b/ *.config.mjs`), a working-directory change (`cd
// harness && sed -i ... index.mjs`, and this tool's cwd persists between calls),
// `find . -name '*.config.mjs' -exec sed -i {} +`, or a base64-decoded path all
// get through. Short of running the shell in a sandbox with the paths mounted
// read-only, no PreToolUse text scan closes those; the review that found them
// is on record.
//
// So this hook is the cheap first line, not the guarantee. The guarantee is
// run-capstone.mjs, which diffs every changed file after the run and VOIDS any
// trial that touched an enforcement path. That check cannot be talked around,
// because it reads the git tree rather than the agent's intent. Prevention here,
// authority there.
//
// Fails closed: a payload it cannot parse is denied rather than waved through,
// matching the repo's hook convention.

// Everything that defines or enforces the constitution, plus the harness that
// measures it. Shares its enforcement core with ENFORCEMENT_PATHS in
// harness/driver/run-capstone.mjs, which is the post-hoc backstop for anything
// that gets past this - but the two lists are NOT required to be equal, and
// harness/gate/protected-paths.test.mjs does not assert that they are. This
// list carries one entry ENFORCEMENT_PATHS deliberately omits: 'experiments/'.
// It is here because this guard also stops READ-contamination (an agent
// finding a prior trial's answers under experiments/, which the capstone
// found happening four times); ENFORCEMENT_PATHS polices WRITE-tampering on
// the committed diff, where 'experiments/' would be dead weight (every
// trial's own commit already excludes it, see run-capstone.mjs) and a future
// landmine if that exclusion ever moves. Do not "fix" this by adding
// 'experiments/' to ENFORCEMENT_PATHS to make the two lists match - that was
// considered and rejected for exactly the landmine reason above.

  // Implementations from previous runs. The capstone found FOUR stages reading
  // a prior trial out of experiments/, including a gate-on trial reading a

  // the one in gate-on t1. Trials are supposed to be independent samples and
