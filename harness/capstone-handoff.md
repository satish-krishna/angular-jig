# Capstone handoff (run this from an angular-jig session)

Read this first, then use the spartan skill and the spartan MCP for all component work (install, selectors, APIs). This is the capstone of the Angular Blueprint series: expand the design-system vocabulary to a full kitchen-sink palette, build the richest honest Tour of Heroes as a conformance target, and run it through the gates. Do the work here, in a session rooted in this repo, so the agent under test inherits the real baseline (both MCP servers, the spartan skill, Angular's generated CLAUDE.md, the house-style skill). The blog repo owns the write-ups only.

The fuller planning context (the series playbook, the Part 5 result, the entropy thesis) lives in the blog repo at `docs/angular-jig-blueprint-playbook.md` and `docs/angular-jig-harness-resumption.md`. This file is the self-contained capstone brief.

## State

- `main` at `d206be4`. Parts 1-5 of the harness are built, measured, and green (`npm run test:harness`, 58 tests).
- Installed spartan components: only `button`, `input`, `card` (plus `libs/ui/utils`). The sealing vocabulary (Part 1) is exactly as wide as `libs/ui`, so there is no gap to close; the gap is what we are about to create by installing more.
- Part 5 finding to keep in mind: on natural Tour of Heroes, the gates are dormant because the model is competent on native patterns. The capstone is the deliberate non-native, dense target where the gates should finally bite.

## The palette (confirmed: full kitchen sink)

All twelve exist in this `@spartan-ng/cli@1.4.1` catalog by exact name, verified against `node_modules/@spartan-ng/cli/src/generators/ui/supported-ui-libraries.json`:

`table`, `select`, `dialog`, `tabs`, `badge`, `avatar`, `tooltip`, `switch`, `textarea`, `field`, `label`, `sidebar`.

Plus: icons (`@ng-icons` core + lucide) and a built theme switcher (light/dark). `card` is already installed; `input` is already installed (forms also want `field` + `label`, which are not).

## Catalog facts (verified, do not re-guess)

- Add a component: `ng g @spartan-ng/cli:ui <name>` (plain Angular CLI schematic; `ng` is not global, invoke via the spartan skill/MCP flow or `npx ng`). The schematic has NO `--skip-install` flag (it was rejected); its flags are `--interactive`, `--defaults`, `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--directory`, `--tags`. It ends by running an npm install, which is where npm 11.0.0's arborist `edgesOut` bug can bite. Prefer the spartan skill/MCP's own install path; if a raw add leaves deps unresolved, repair with `npx -y npm@latest install` (with the sandbox disabled). Confirm `npm run build` after.
- Icons: `@ng-icons/core` + `@ng-icons/lucide` (pulled in when a component that needs them is added). Pattern is per-component: `import { NgIcon, provideIcons } from '@ng-icons/core'`, `import { lucideX } from '@ng-icons/lucide'`, `providers: [provideIcons({ lucideX })]`, then `<ng-icon name="lucideX" />`. There is NO `hlm-icon` wrapper (retired; `migrate-icon` exists for that reason). Raw inline `<svg>` is the thing the new icon gate rule bans.
- Theme: a `.dark` class toggled on `<html>`. `src/styles.css` already defines `:root { ... }` and `:root.dark { ... }` including the full `--sidebar*` token set. Build the switcher with `document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark')`; persist the choice.
- Sidebar: a real component (`HlmSidebar` + `HlmSidebarTrigger`, `HlmSidebarMenu*`, `HlmSidebarGroup*`, `HlmSidebarRail`, a service and a token). Install it; do not hand-compose. `navigation-menu` is a separate primitive if a top nav is also wanted.

## The plan

1. **Install the palette.** Add the twelve components via the spartan flow. Let icons/theme deps come in with them. Get `npm run build` green with everything installed (unused libs do not enter the build graph, so a clean build just proves the install did not break package.json/tsconfig).
2. **Expand the constitution (the "extend the vocabulary" work, which is also Part 7's content).** For each newly installed primitive that fits the existing raw-control shape (table, field, label, select, textarea, switch, dialog, tabs, badge, avatar, tooltip), extend, doc-first: the house-style skill (`.claude/skills/house-style/SKILL.md` and the byte-identical `.agents/skills/house-style/SKILL.md`), then `harness/sealing-spec.md`, then the gate (`harness/gate/index.mjs` and its rule files), the counter (`harness/counter/counter.mjs`), and the fixtures. The gate and counter must stay two independent engines encoding one spec, as they are today. Add a NEW rule kind for icons: no raw inline `<svg>`; register via `provideIcons` and render with `<ng-icon>`. The theme switcher is app code, not a vocabulary rule. The sidebar's smart/dumb placement is Part 3 (component-shape) territory, not Part 1 sealing.
3. **Build the rich prototype.** The DESIGN target already exists, committed at `prototype/tour-of-heroes.html`: an interactive, themeable, kitchen-sink Tour of Heroes reimagined as a "Hero Ops Console" (a superhero-agency mission control). It carries the whole palette in one place, a collapsible icon sidebar, a top bar with search and a working light/dark theme toggle, dashboard stat tiles, top-hero cards, a sortable/filterable roster data table, a hero detail with an avatar header, status/class badges, tabs (Overview/Powers/Missions/Edit), a schema-style edit form with validation and a switch, and a retire-hero confirmation dialog. That HTML is the visual and UX target (plain HTML + Tailwind-ish CSS, NOT real spartan). The Angular build reproduces it with the REAL sealed spartan primitives (`hlm-table`, `hlm-select`, `hlm-dialog`, `hlm-tabs`, `hlm-sidebar`, `hlm-badge`, `hlm-avatar`, `hlm-tooltip`, `hlm-switch`, `hlm-field`/`hlm-label`, `ng-icon`), the `.dark`-class theme switcher, and the MVVM pattern below, under all gates. Open the prototype in a browser to see the target; conformance is measured against it.
4. **Run the capstone** the established way: gate-off vs gate-on, all gates present (Parts 1-5 plus the expanded vocabulary), drift counted by the independent counters (the AST counters plus the Part 5 Playwright responsive auditor), three trials per condition. Report the drift the baseline shipped, what the gates caught, and the residue.

## MVVM (the house pattern the capstone enforces; user definition, precise)

The ViewModel is an `@Injectable` service holding all logic and state as signals, unit-testable with zero DOM. The component is a thin shell that lists the VM in its own `providers: [XViewModel]` (component-scoped, NOT `providedIn: 'root'`), injects it, and binds the template to `vm` signals. This is idiomatic Angular (the ComponentStore/presenter shape, signal-native), not literal WPF. It is a new constitutional rule and is decidable/gateable: the component declares a `*ViewModel` in `providers` and injects it; state signals live in the VM, not the component class; the class stays thin. It REFINES Part 3 (which said the smart component holds the signals): the signals move into the VM. Write that reconciliation into the house doc deliberately, or the Part 3 shape gate and the MVVM rule will disagree about where state lives.

## What the capstone is really testing

The Parts 4-5 nulls produced the series' sharpest thesis: the gates fire in proportion to a pattern's distance from the model's priors. Native patterns are dormant; non-native house patterns (schema forms, MVVM-as-VM-service, a sealed table vocabulary) are where drift lives. The capstone aims dead at that non-native zone. It is also the place to measure the uniformity claim rather than assert it: the run driver already records `num_turns`, `cost_usd`, and `duration_ms` per trial, so a uniform-substrate vs varied-substrate comparison on those numbers turns the gut into a chart. Do not ship that claim as a gut; the blog's whole ethos is to run it.

## Harness and environment reminders

- Specs: `harness/sealing-spec.md` (Part 1), `harness/layout-grammar-spec.md` (2), `harness/component-shape-spec.md` (3), `harness/freeloader-spec.md` (4), `harness/responsive-spec.md` (5). Driver: `harness/driver/run-trial.mjs`. Tests: `npm run test:harness`.
- npm 11.0.0 arborist bug: install through `npx -y npm@latest install` with the sandbox disabled.
- File delete/rename under `D:\Repos` is sandbox-blocked: run all `git` natively (PowerShell), delete stray files natively.
- Never leave an untracked file in the repo root: the run driver refuses a trial when the tree is dirty outside `experiments/`.
- Run trials one at a time (they check out branches); run them in the background to dodge the 10-minute tool timeout.
- Publishing policy: the series ships as one, held in draft. Do not promote to `articles/`, flip status, add canonical, or make this repo public early.
