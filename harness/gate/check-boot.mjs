// The boot gate (`npm run check:boot`).
//
// Renders every route and fails on an uncaught runtime error. This is the plane
// the capstone showed was missing, and it is aimed at a family rather than a
// rule: three of the four genuinely fatal defects that run produced were
// dependency-injection failures, and no AST rule reached any of them.
//
//   - `NgIconsModule` imported with no root-level `provideIcons`: throws at
//     bootstrap, blank page, three of six builds.
//   - A component-scoped ViewModel injected but never provided: NullInjectorError
//     on first render.
//   - `hlm-dialog-content` rendered inline instead of on `*hlmDialogPortal`:
//     spartan supplies `BrnDialogRef` through the portal, so inline content has
//     no provider and the screen throws NG0201 when the dialog is constructed.
//
// Every one of those compiles cleanly, passes strictTemplates, and passes every
// gate in this repo. They are well-formed code with real primitives and checked
// types that fails only when Angular actually assembles the graph. A static rule
// cannot see it; a browser sees it immediately.
//
// The cost of adding this was near zero, which is the uncomfortable part: the
// harness ALREADY boots every build for the responsive audit and was throwing
// the console away.
//
// This gate is deliberately NOT double-encoded the way the AST rules are. A
// thrown error is an observation the browser hands you, not a judgment about the
// code, so a second independent implementation would be the same three lines of
// Playwright API. The independence that matters is kept elsewhere: the responsive
// auditor captures page errors during its OWN navigation, in its own code path,
// and the driver records both. See responsive-spec.md.
//
// Usage:
//   node harness/gate/check-boot.mjs [--route dashboard --route roster ...]
